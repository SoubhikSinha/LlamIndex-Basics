# LlamaIndex - Basics

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline powered by **LlamaIndex**, integrating **local document loaders, vector databases**, and **custom embedding pipelines** to enable highly efficient, context-aware responses from LLMs. It covers every step from data ingestion and chunking to embedding generation, vector storage, and intelligent query retrieval â€” all orchestrated inside interactive Jupyter notebooks for clarity and experimentation. The project highlights how to optimize RAG systems for performance and accuracy through chunk-size tuning, prompt refinement, and hybrid retrieval strategies. With support for **local or cloud-based LLMs**, this implementation serves as a hands-on learning template for anyone building **production-ready GenAI or question-answering systems** using open-source frameworks. Designed with scalability in mind, it showcases how modular service components (document loaders, embedding managers, and retrievers) can be swapped easily to integrate into enterprise or research pipelines.  _Deep gratitude to [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06) for his educational guidance and open-source contributions that inspired this project._
